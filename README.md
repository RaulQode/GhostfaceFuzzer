# 🧠 Overview

GhostfaceFuzzer is an adversarial testing toolkit designed to uncover vulnerabilities in AI models and systems. Whether you're testing Large Language Models (LLMs), image classifiers, or decision-making pipelines, GhostfaceFuzzer provides the mechanisms to probe, break, and analyze AI behavior under adversarial and stress conditions.

Inspired by stealth tactics and fuzzing strategies in cybersecurity, this tool aims to reveal blind spots in model robustness, fairness, and safety.

## ⚙️ Features

🔍 Adversarial Input Generation: Textual and prompt-based fuzzing strategies for LLMs.

🖼️ Perturbation-based attacks: Pixel-level noise and transformations for computer vision models.

🧪 Model-Agnostic Evaluation: Plug-and-play support for PyTorch, HuggingFace, and REST API-based models.

📊 Reporting Engine: Logs anomalies, hallucinations, misclassifications, and failure patterns.

🦾 Automation Ready: Easily integrate into CI pipelines or red team simulations.
